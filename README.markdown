MacSosumi
=========

A Mac OS X desktop client for Apple's [Find My iPhone service](http://www.apple.com/mobileme/features/find-my-iphone.html).

MacSosumi was made possible by the work of the original [Sosumi](https://github.com/tylerhall/sosumi) project.

Much love to the iCloud team for a wonderful service :-)
